# Developing FarmbotOS
Farmbot OS is built using the Nerves Project. We suggest you follow the
[Getting Started Guide](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/getting-started.html).

When all dependencies are installed according to the above guide, you  
should be able to simply do

``` bash
mix deps.get
iex -S mix
```

Then if you want to test on real hardware you can follow the BUILDING guide.
